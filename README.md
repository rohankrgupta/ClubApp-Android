# UniDayz-Android-Application

This is a inter-college based social network andoid application supporting live messaging features and multiple authentication channels using Firebase. Currently working on to eliminate possible bugs for deploying on the Google Play Store.

If one wants to check the App without Downloading the code and deploying on Android Studio, I have also provided the .apk file. 

Some Screenshots from the Project are given below
